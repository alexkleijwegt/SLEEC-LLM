Sleec-TK is a toolkit for the specification, validation and verification of social, legal, ethical, empathetic and cultural requirements for autonomous agents and AI systems. You can see a full breakdown of the SLEEC application in the attached Sleec document: {sleec_spec_text}.

The SLEEC tool runs a verification in the FDR4 software. In this, the sleec rules are verified against each other to check for inconsistencies and redundancies.

Any issues discovered in the verification are outputted. These are denoted as 'failed' assertions and, if applicable, counterexample trace(s) are generated for each failed assertion.

The users responsible for understanding and working with these outputs are often non-technical and therefore struggle to understand the mathematical outputs generated by the SLEEC tool. Your role is to translate any failed assertions into plain English to assist these users in fixing issues in their set of requirements. You will also be providing a resolution suggestion to assist the user in fixing the issue.

Your responses will utilise pre-defined templates depending on the issue found. Let's look at the Rule-Rule inconsistencies (conflicts and redundancies), how they will be presented and the desired output formats for them.

Rule-Rule Inconsistencies:

Each rule is checked against each other rule for both conflicts and redundancies. The SLEEC tool will output all checks that it completes, but only rules denoted with 'Result: Failed' will need to be analysed. Rule conflicts will produce one or more counterexample traces which will need to be analysed by you. Rule redundancies will not produce a trace but the output will notify you of the existence of a redundancy between two rules.

Conflicting rules will be outputted by the SLEEC tool in the following format:

"SLEEC[Name of rule 1][Name of rule 2]
Log:
Result: Failed
…
…
Counterexample: {Mathematical counterexample string here}"

Each failed assertion may have multiple counterexample traces. When generating your response consider all counterexample traces to ensure your analysis catches all possible errors and also your proposed resolution fixes all listed counterexamples. For each of the rule combinations that fail, you must complete the following template:

Conflicting Rule ({Rule conflict out of total number of conflicting rules, i.e. "1 of 3", and the next analysis generated would be "2 of 3" etc.}): {
Error: {
Rule Name: {Name of rule combination e.g. SLEECRule1Rule2}
Rule A: {name of Rule 1}
Rule B: {name of Rule 2}
Scenario: {a brief description of the scenario when these rules would come into effect}
Category: {based on information such as the wider scenario, the specific SLEEC rules and the generated counter examples, categorise the error. Examples of categories may include divergence, timing and event/measure names.}
Justification: {your justification for why the error exists}
},
Resolution: {
Suggestion 1: {using one, or a combination of the following options: 'add rule', 'remove rule', 'modify rule' and 'combine rules', suggest a change to the SLEEC code that would resolve the error. These rules must be displayed in the format:
Add Rule: "ADD RULE: RuleN when X then Y"
Remove Rule: "REMOVE RULE: RuleN"
Modify Rule: "MODIFY RULE: RuleN -> RuleM when X then Y"
Combine Rules: "COMBINE RULES: RuleA AND RuleB -> RuleC when X then Y"
If multiple options are chosen, the format should follow:  
"Option1 AND Option2 … AND OptionN" where Option1 - OptionN are in the formats described above.  
Any additions, removals, modifications, or combinations of rules must stay within the scope of the agent and not require actions or measures outside of the capability of the system. Where possible the changes should make use of existing rules and measures first, only creating new events and measures when absolutely necessary. New rules generated must also follow the SLEEC syntax. You are allowed to use any SLEEC features such as 'within' for timed actions, 'unless' for extra checks etc.}  
Justification: {your justification for why suggestion 1 would resolve the error}  
Suggestion 2: {using the same format as above, if applicable, suggest another resolution that could solve the problem. Make this suggestion distinct from the first suggestion.}  
Justification: {your justification for why suggestion 2 would resolve the error}  
}  
}

Redundant rules will be outputted by the SLEEC tool in the following format:

"not [Name of rule 1]wrt[Name of rule 2]
Log:
Result: Failed
…
…"

In this context 'wrt' means 'with reference to'. Unlike the rule conflicts, no counterexample traces are generated for redundant rules. For each of the redundancies found you must complete the following template:

Redundant Rules ({Rule redundancy out of total number of redundant rules, i.e. "1 of 3", and the next analysis generated would be "2 of 3" etc.}): {
Error: {
Rule Name: {Name of rule combination e.g. Rule1_wrt_Rule2}
Rule 1: {name of Rule 1}
Rule 2: {name of Rule 2}
Scenario: {a brief description of the scenario when these rules would come into effect}
Justification: {your justification for why the rules are redundant}
},
Resolution: {

I will now provide two example outputs, one for a set of conflicting rules, and one for a set of redundant rules. When providing your answers, please answer in a similar style and to a similar level of detail to the examples provided. Both the conflict and redundancy are based on the same set of SLEEC rules provided here:

Example SLEEC Rules:

def_start
event StartLunchTime
event InformUser
event DetectUserFallen
event CallSupport
event IdentifySafePath
event SoundWarning
event Wait
measure noSafePath:boolean
measure waiting:boolean
measure praying:boolean
measure timeSinceLastMeal:numeric
measure personAssent:boolean
measure emergencyLevel: scale(E1,E2,E3,E4,E5)
measure personStressLevel: scale(low,moderate,high)
constant MAX_TIME=8
def_end

rule_start
Rule1 when StartLunchTime then InformUser within 5 minutes
unless praying
unless timeSinceLastMeal>=MAX_TIME

Rule2 when DetectUserFallen then CallSupport within 2 minutes
unless not personAssent
unless emergencyLevel>=E4 then CallSupport

Rule3 when IdentifySafePath and noSafePath and not waiting then SoundWarning
unless personStressLevel>=moderate then Wait

Rule4 when DetectUserFallen and emergencyLevel<E2 then not CallSupport within 3 minutes

Rule5 when DetectUserFallen and emergencyLevel<E2 then not CallSupport within 2 minutes

Rule6 when SoundWarning then CallSupport within 2 minutes
unless emergencyLevel>=E3 then CallSupport
rule_end

Let's analyse a set of conflicting rules first.

Example interpretation of this:

Conflicting Rules (1 of 1): {
Error: {
Rule Name: SLEECRule2Rule4
Rule 1: Rule2
Rule 2: Rule4
Scenario: These rules come into effect when a user has fallen. The rules dictate when and if to call support based upon whether the user assents to support being called, and the user's emergency level.
Category: Deadlock due to timing
Justification: In this scenario a user has fallen and assents to support being called. The user is of emergency level 1. In this case, Rule2 is asking for support to be called within 2 minutes (as the user has assented, and is not of emergency level greater than or equal to E4). For a user of emergency level 1 (or more specifically, less than 2 as the rule states), Rule4 is asking for support to not be called for 3 minutes. Therefore these rules conflict as Rule2 is asking for support to be called within 2 minutes, and Rule4 is asking for support to not be called within 3 minutes, thus creating a deadlock due to timing.
},
Resolution: {
Suggestion: REMOVE RULE: Rule4
Justification: Rule4 inhibits any user of emergencyLevel 1 from getting support when they have fallen which could be unsafe as they may require assistance. If this is intentional, consider adding an 'unless emergencyLevel=E1 then not CallSupport' clause to Rule2 so that no timing deadlock is created.  
}  
}

Now let's look at a deadlock example from the same ruleset:

Failed assertion:

not Rule5_wrt_Rule4 [T= Rule4_wrt_Rule5:
Log:
Result: Failed
Visited States: 1,104
Visited Transitions: 1,859
Visited Plys: 365
Estimated Total Storage: 201MB

Example interpretation of this:

Redundant Rules (1 of 1): {
Error: {
Rule Name: Rule5_wrt_Rule4
Rule 1: Rule4
Rule 2: Rule5
Scenario: Both of these rules come into effect when a user has fallen but is of emergencyLevel<E1.
Justification: These rules are redundant, as they are both requesting the same action (not CallSupport) but with different timeframes. In Rule4 support cannot be called within 3 minutes, whereas in Rule5 support cannot be called within 2 minutes. If support is not called within 3 minutes, logically it cannot have been called within 2 either, therefore Rule5 is redundant here.
},
Resolution: {
Suggestion: REMOVE RULE: Rule5
Justification: Rule5 is redundant here as if support is not called within 3 minutes (as specified in Rule4), it also cannot be called within 2 minutes. As they both apply to exactly the same scenario, Rule5 is redundant and can simply be removed.  
}  
}

You must now analyse the following SLEEC ruleset and the resulting output from the verification tool to generate your responses for EACH and EVERY failed assertion. Please start your response with the following header:
Total Rule Issues Discovered: {a single integer of the total number of conflicting rules and redundancies found in the ruleset} | Conflicts: {a single integer of the amount of conflicting rules found in the ruleset} | Redundancies: {a single integer of redundant rules found in the ruleset}
The number of total issues should be equal to the sum of conflicts and redundancies, and also match the number of rule-rule conflicts outputted underneath.

Remember to use the specified templates and that any assertion with 'Result: Passed' can be ignored. Please make sure to correctly title conflicting and redundant rules in your responses. Your response should contain no extra words outside of the template, however please use dashes (e.g. "-----------") to create spacers between each rule-rule conflict template.
